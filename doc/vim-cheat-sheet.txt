My Personal Vim Cheat Sheet                         (for my vimrc version 2.1.0)
================================================================================

This cheat sheet is to be used together with my personal vimrc file
(see https://bitbucket.org/burrima/sysutil/src/master/README.md)

References ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  [1] Practical Vim, Edit Text at the Speed of Thought, Drew Neil, 2012
  [2] Modern Vim, Craft Your Development Environment with Vim 8 and Neovim,
      Drew Neil, 2018

How To Read This Cheat Sheet ---------------------------------------------------
Note: the terminology used is aligned with [1] and [2].
  xy                key x followed by key y
  A,B,C or D        command A, command B, command C (=same as D) explained
  <Esc>,<CR>        Escape key, Return key, etc.
  <Leader>          <Leader> key (currently mapped to ',')
  <C-x>             while holding <Ctrl> key, press x key
  <C-x>{motion}     <C-x>, then release keys and press any motion key
  :{command}        Ex command = : key followed by command and implicit <CR>
  "{register}       " key followed by register name, see section Registers
  [count]x          optional number [count] before pressing x
  $ <command>       issue command on bash shell (implicit <CR> to start command)

The Vim Way --------------------------------------------------------------------
See [1], Tip 1-11:
  * don't repeat yourself, use '.' (dot) command to repeat the last change
  * don't count if you can repeat (e.g. use 'x.....' instead of '6x')
  * make changes repeatable (e.g. use 's' instead of 'xi')
  * act, react, reverse: Make change, repeat it, reverse if done too often
  * make reasonable undo chunks (chunk = from normal to insert mode and back)
    (note: arrow keys act like '<Esc>hi', breaking the chunk - use hjkl keys)
  * dot formula: The ideal: One keystroke to move, another to execute
  * builtin help: ":h <term>" (jump to links with <Space>g and back with <C-o>)

Modes --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vim has different modes and each mode has its own set of commands:
 * Normal mode - to navigate, think, prepare etc. - used most often
 * Insert mode - type actual text
 * Visual mode - select characters, lines or rectangular blocks
 * Replace mode - replace single char or multiple characters
 * Command-Line mode - to enter Ex commands
 * Operator-Pending mode - implicit mode between Operator and Motion

Normal Mode Commands -----------------------------------------------------------
Basic Commands
  i,a,I,A           insert/append to cursor or start/end of line in Insert mode
  r,R               switch to (single char, multi char) Replace mode
  v,V,<C-v>         switch to Visual character, line or block mode
  gv                re-select last selection (and enter Visual mode)
  :                 switch to Command-Line mode (enter Ex commands)
  u,<C-r>           undo, redo
  <C-l>             clear screen (clear search highlights too)
  x,"{register}x    cut character to unnamed or specific register
  p,"{register}p    put = paste from unnamed register or specific register
  gp,"{register}gp  same as 'p' but place cursor at end of inserted region
  [count]<C-a>      add count to digit below cursor or to the right
  [count]<C-x>      subtract count from digit below cursor or to the right
  .                 repeat last change (very powerful command! see ":h .")
  @:                repeat last Ex cmd (useful when [range] of Ex is selection)
  @@                repeat last @ operation (macro or Ex cmd)

  Notes:
    * switching from insert to normal mode creates an undo junk (note: arrow
      keys in insert mode are like <Esc><arrow>i)
    * use xp to swap 2 characters
    * most commands can be run n times: [count]<command>, e.g. 2x
    * explicit copy-paste is called yank-put in Vim (historical reasons)

Motions ------------------------------------------------------------------------
To move around in Normal and Visual modes and to combine with Operator commands
  h,j,k,l           left, down, up, right
  w,b,e,W,B,E       to next, previous, end word or WORD (=sequence of non-space)
  0,$               to start, end of line
  g0,g$             to first, last non-blank char of line (alias for ^ and g_)
  f{char},t{char}   to occurrence of char in line (incl/excl char) to right
  F{char},T{char}   to occurrence of char in line (incl/excl char) to left
  ö or ;            repeat last f,t,F or T (ö is in close reach)
  é or ,            repeat last f,t,F or T in opposite direction
  {count}|          to screen column {count} in the current line

Operator Commands --------------------------------------------------------------
To be used with a Motion, a Text Object, a search or in Visual Mode
  <operator>        switch to Operator-Pending mode (waiting for Motion)
  >,<,=             shift right, left, auto-indent
  y,"{register}y    yank (i.e. copy) to unnamed or specific register
  c,"{register}c    change (with prior save to unnamed or specific register)
  d,"{register}d    cut to unnamed or specific register (mnemonic: delete)
  g~,gu,gU          swap case, make lowercase, make uppercase
  gq                reformat to maximum line length (see :h tw)

  Notes:
    * Action = Operator + Motion (operator commands are applied to a marked
      range or require a motion) - powerful combinations!
    * power move: use search as motion, e.g. "d/{search-term}<CR>"
    * operator doubling (e.g. dd) = apply to whole line

Text Objects -------------------------------------------------------------------
To be typed after an Operator command or in Visual mode - to specify a range
  a',a"             a pair of 'single quotes', "double quotes"
  a) or ab          a pair of (parentheses)
  a} or aB          a pair of {braces}
  a],a>             a pair of [brackets], <angle brackets>
  at                a pair of <xml>tags</xml>
  aw,aW             current word/WORD plus one space (a word)
  as,ap             current sentence, paragraph plus one space

  Notes:
    * each 'a' has its 'i' counterpart, meaning 'inside' or 'inner' (no space)
    * Text Objects are not motions themselves (not usable for navigation)

Marks & Jumps ------------------------------------------------------------------
  m{mark},'{mark}   set mark, jump to mark (a-z=local, A-Z=global mark)
  gg,G              jump to top, bottom of file
  g;,g,             jump to previous, next change (traverse change list)
  gi                short for '^i (jump to last change and go to Insert mode)
  <C-o>,<C-i>       jump back, forward (traverse jump list)
  %                 jump between opening and closing (), {}, [] and keywords
  (,),{,}           jump to next, previous sentence, paragraph
  H,M,L             jump to top, middle, bottom of screen

  Automatic Marks (read-only):
  ''                position before the last jump within current file
  '.                location of last change
  '^                location of last insertion
  '[,']             start, end of last yank or change
  '<,'>             start, end of (current or) last Visual selection

  Notes:
    * jumps can also be combined with Operator commands
    * motions move around within a file, some jumps can move between files
    * set a global mark before going code diving (easy return to start)
    * Vim maintains a change list for each individual buffer (see ":changes")
    * Vim maintains a jump list for each individual window (see ":jumps")

Compound Commands --------------------------------------------------------------
Simplification for often used combinations
  I  = ^i           insert at the beginning of line
  A  = $a           append at end of line
  C  = c$           change till end of line
  S  = ^C           change from first non-empty char to end of line
  J  = A<Del><Esc>  join 2 lines (append lower line to the current one)
  o  = A<CR>        start new line in insert mode
  O  = ko           start new line in insert mode above current line
  P  = hp           paste before current position, gP to place cursor after text
  s  = cl           change char
  X  = hx           cut char left
  ~  = g~l          change case of character

Visual Mode Commands -----------------------------------------------------------
  <Esc>             switch to Normal mode
  v,V,<C-v>         change to Visual character, Visual line or Visual block mode
  ~                 change case of selection
  p,"{register}p    replace selection with unnamed, specific register content
  o                 jump to other end of selected text

  Notes:
    * when using dot command to repeat Visual mode command, it acts on the same
      range of text as was marked before, thus:
    * prefer operators over Visual commands where possible
    * use Visual block mode to edit tabular data, also to insert, replace or
      append over several lines (i.e. "columns" of text),
      even to append to end of line over ragged text (see [1], Tip 24-26)
      (alternatively use ":normal A;" over selected range to append ';')

Insert Mode Commands -----------------------------------------------------------
  <Esc>             switch to Normal mode
  <C-o>             switch to Insert Normal mode (1-shot Normal mode command)
  <backspace>       delete back one letter
  <C-w>             delete back one word (works in Ex and Bash as well)
  <C-u>             delete back to start of line (works in Ex and Bash as well)
  <C-r>{register}   paste content of register

  Notes:
    * <C-w> becomes efficient when feeling a typo at the beginning of the word
      while typing fluently
    * <C-o> becomes handy to center screen while typing: "<C-o>zz" vs "<Esc>zza"

Command-line Mode Commands -----------------------------------------------------
  <Esc>             switch to Normal mode
  <C-r>{register}   paste content of register into cmd line
  <C-r><C-w>        copy-paste word under cursor into cmd line
  <C-r><C-a>        copy-paste WORD under cursor into cmd line

  :n                jump to line number n
  :cd               change working directory
  :reg[register]    show contents of specific or common registers
  :set list         show invisible characters (newline etc)
  :sort[!][i][u]    sort (!=reverse, i=ignore-case, u=unique) see ":h sort"
  :[range]t {addr}  (short for :copy) copy [range] of lines to {address}
  :[range]m {addr}  (short for :move) move [range] of lines to {address}

  :!{cmd}           execute {cmd} with the shell
  :[range]!{filter} filter [range] through external program {filter}
  :[range]write !{cmd}  execute {cmd} in the shell with [range] lines as stdin
  :read !{cmd}      execute {cmd} in the shell and put its stdout below cursor

  :args [files]     show/edit argument list (use * or ** (=incl. subdirs))
  :argdo {cmd}      repeat cmd for each buffer in the argument list
                    (e.g. useful for ":argdo normal {cmds}")

  :[range]normal {cmds}
                    execute Normal mode {cmds} on each specified line. Also
                    useful in combination with macros: ":[range]normal @a"

  Ranges:
    :{address}      single line address: n=line-number, .=current-line,
                    'm=line-containing-mark-m ('<,'>=start,end-of-selection),
                    /{term}/=search-term, 1=first-line-of-file,
                    0=virtual-line-above-1, $=last-line-of-file
    :{address}+n    modify an address, using an offset of lines
    :{start},{end}  start and end addresses
    :%              whole file (short for :1,$)

  Notes:  See also [1], p. 51ff
    *  Vim has Ex cmds for everything, see ":h ex-cmd-index" (e.g. copy, yank)
    *  Ex cmds can be applied to many lines at once (sometimes more powerful
       than Normal mode cmds). Ex cmds strike far and wide.
    * :t. and :m. are like yyp or ddp without overwriting the default register
    * q: to open command history to re-issue (edited) command by <CR>
    * in Ex cmds: % = "current file path", %:h = "% without file name

Patterns, Search & Replace -----------------------------------------------------
In Normal mode:
  *,#               go to the next, previous occurrence of word under cursor
  n,N               find next, find previous occurrence
  /{pattern}        open command line to forward-search the {pattern}
  ?{pattern}        open command line to backward-search the {pattern}
  q/,q?             open buffer of search history to edit and re-issue with <CR>

  :[range]global/{pattern}/[cmd]
                    execute Ex [cmd] on all specified lines where {pattern}
                    matches
  :[range]substitute/{pattern}/{string}/[flags]
                    replace occurrences of {pattern} with {string} on each
                    specified line with [flags]: g=whole line, c=ask, n=count

  Notes:
    * use Operator commands together with / and ? and feel the power
    * use /{pattern}/e and ?{pattern}?e to set the cursor to the end of match
    * use \c anywhere in pattern to force case insensitive search
    * use \v (very magic, with regex) and \V (verbatim, plain-text) in pattern
    * use \zs and \ze (zoom start/end) to mark only part of the search term
    * decouple search (/\v...) and replace(:s//.../g) for cleaner workflow
    * see ":h pattern-searches" for full explanation of this topic
    * manual search/replace: Use '*' to search, 'cw' to replace, 'n.' to repeat
      (rationale: decide for each occurrence to replace or not)

Registers ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ""                unnamed register
  "a,"A             named register: local [a-z], global [A-Z]
  "0                yank register (contains last yank)
  "_                blackhole register (similar to NULL device)
  "+,"*             system clipboard (ctrl-c), X11 primary (middle mouse button)
  ".                last inserted text
  "/                last search pattern
  "=                expression register (see ":h quote=")
  :reg a            show content of register a

  Notes:
    * all delete or change operations store to unnamed register by default
    * use "_ or "0 (or named registers) when combining yank and change/delete
    * use ":set paste"/":set nopaste" on problems pasting from system clipboard

Windows, Tabs  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  <C-w>s or :split  split window
  <C-w>v or :vs     vertical split window
  <C-w>x            navigate to window x=h,j,k,l
  <C-w>X            move window X=H,J,K,L
  <C-w>=            make all windows same size (auto-adjust)
  <C-w>+,<C-w->-    increase, decrease current window size
  <C-w>|,<C-w>_     maximize current window in width, height (<C-w>= to restore)
  <C-w>gf           open the file whose name is under the cursor in a new tab
  :q[uit],qa[ll]    quit the current, all window(s) (use :q! to force unsaved)
  :te [file]        open [file] in new tab (te=tabedit in vimrc)
  :tc               close current tab (incl. all split windows) (tc=tabclose)
  gt,gT,{n}gt       next, previous, n-th tab
  :tabm i           move current tab to position i
  <C-w>T            move current split to a separate tab

  Notes:
    * opening a file is easy with FZF plugin: Press <Space>f, then search,
      select with <C-p>,<C-n> and press <CR>, <C-v>, <C-s> or <C-t> to open in
      active window, new vertical split, new horizontal split or new tab
    * prefer splits over tabs (tabs are more like "virtual desktops")

Navigation in a Window:
  zz,zt,zb          scroll cursor position to center, top, bottom
  <C-f>,<C-d>,<C-e> scroll down full page, half page, one line
  <C-b>,<C-u>,<C-y> scroll up full page, half page, one line

Buffers ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <Space>b          show buffer list using FZF plugin (use fuzzy search or
                    buffer number) to load buffer
  <Space>#          switch back to previous buffer (=alternate buffer) in window
  [B,]B,[b,]b       load first, last, prev, next buffer to active window
                    (short for :bfirst, :blast, :bprev, :bnext)
  :bd[elete]        close current buffer (:q closes window, but not buffer)
  :up[date]         update buffer to file (write if changed, otherwise not)
  :w[rite] [file]   write buffer to current or new [file]
  :wa[ll]           write all changed buffers to file
  :!mkdir -p %:h    create directory for current file (if not existing yet)

Quickfix List / Location Lists -------------------------------------------------
  <Space>q,<Space>l open Quickfix-, Location-list (short for :copen,:lopen)
  [Q,]Q,[q,]q       jump to next, previous, first, last item in quickfix list
                    (short for :cfirst, :clast, :cprev, :cnext)
  [L,]L,[l,]l       jump to next, previous, first, last item in location list
                    (short for :lfirst, :llast, :lprev, :lnext)
  :cnfile,:lnfile   jump to first item in next file
  :cpfile,:lpfile   jump to last item in previous file
  :colder,:lolder   load older Quickfix-, Location-list
  :cnewer,:lnewer   load newer Quickfix-, Location-list

  Notes:
    * Quickfix list is global and unique, Location list is per window

Macros -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  q{register}       record macro to register a-z (only small letters!)
  [n]@{regster}     replay macro from register n times (stops when motion fails)
  [n]@@             replay last macro n times
  qA                append to macro in register a
  :[argdo] normal @a  run macro once on each line [in each file of the arg list]

  Notes:
    * ideal for repeating changes on similar lines, paragraphs or files
    * golden rule: when recording, ensure that every command is repeatable
    * normalize start position, use jumps, text objects (full Vim arsenal)
    * macros use normal registers, so you can  paste-edit-yank register
    * use of iterator possible via expression register, e.g:
      :let i=1<CR> qa I<C-r>=i<CR>)<CR><Esc> :let i+=1<CR> q

Autocompletion -----------------------------------------------------------------
Currently done with the ALE plugin and a language-server running in the back.
  <C-n>,<C-p>       generic keywords
  <C-x><C-o>        omni-completion (via ALE language-server backend)
  <C-x><C-n>        current buffer keywords
  <C-x><C-i>        included files keywords
  <C-x><C-]>        tags file keywords
  <C-x><C-k>        dictionary lookup
  <C-x><C-l>        whole line completion
  <C-x><C-f>        file name completion

  Pop-up Menu Commands:
  <C-n>,<C-p>       use the next, previous match (arrow keys work as well)
  <C-l>             add one character from first match in list
  <C-w>             delete (selected) word (generic command useful everywhere)
  <C-e>             revert the originally typed text (exit from auto-completion)

Spell Checking -----------------------------------------------------------------
  :set spellfile=   name of word list where new words are added (*.{enc}.add)
  :set spell[!]     enable [or disable] spell checking

  [s,]s             jump to previous, next misspelled word
  z=                for the word under/after cursor suggest correct word
  zg N              add word under cursor as good word to first/n-th spellfile
  zw N              same as zg but mark word as bad
  zug,zuw           undo last zg, zw command

Code Navigation ----------------------------------------------------------------
  [T,]T,[t,]t       jump to first, last, next, previous item in tag match list
  <Space>t          prompt user to choose an item (short for :tselect)

Vimdiff & Git Integration ------------------------------------------------------
In Normal mode:
  [C,[c,]c,]C       jump to the first, prev, next, last hunk in current buffer
  <Leader>gp        show diff of current hunk
  <Leader>gu        undo current hunk (use 'u' to undo if not satisfied)

  <Leader>gs        git status (<c-n>,<c-p> to navigate, -,+ to stage, unstage))
  <leader>gl        show git log (<C-n>,<C-p> for down/up, <CR> to view commit)
  <Leader>gd        show diff of current buffer in new tab (l: index, r: local)

  :Gwrite,:Gread    "git add", "git checkout" of file in current window
  :Gedit            open indexed version of file (":Gedit :0" of current file)
  :Gmove,:Gremove   "git mv", "git rm" of current file
  :Gblame           "git blame"
  :Gitcommit        open the commit window to create a commit
  :Gdiff!           open 3-way vimdiff to solve merge conflicts
  :Git {cmd}        run any git command externally (e.g. :Git add .)

In "vimdiff mode":
  [C,[c,]c,]C       jump to the first, prev, next, last hunk in current buffer
  :[range]diffg[et] modify current buffer to undo diff to with another buffer
  :[range]diffpu[t] modify another buffer to undo diff with current buffer
  do,dp             short for :diffget,:diffput (no range, no visual) do=obtain
  :Gwrite[!]        add file in current buffer directly to the index
  <Leader>gc or :tc close git diff windows (shortcut for :tabclose)

Notes:
  * use "<Leader>gs", select file, then press <CR>, then "<Leader>gd" to
    review changes and stage them
  * watch http://vimcasts.org/e/31 (32, 33, 34)

Plugins ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * add/remove entry in .vimrc, then restart Vim and type :PackUpdate/:PackClean
  * type ":h {plugin-name}" to get help

Installed plugins, and their specific shortcuts (see vimrc file):
